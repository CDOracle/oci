# Extend your SaaS Applications with AI Agent Studio

## Introduction

AI Agent Studio is a design-time environment that empowers you to create, configure, validate, and deploy GenAI features and AI agents to meet your organization's needs. With AI Agent Studio, you can easily extend pre-configured agent templates, and even build new agents and multi-agent workflows from scratch. AI Agent Studio is fully integrated into Fusion Applications, providing secure and seamless access to the knowledge stores, tools, and APIs of Fusion Applications. This integration enables agents to be deployed directly into the workflow, ensuring an efficient process.

## Summary

As you have seen, AI Agent Studio puts customers in the driver’s seat, helping empower you to design the future of AI in your organizations on top of a bedrock of trust and safety. AI Agent Studio includes a built-in testing environment, validation, and traceability tools to confirm accuracy. Oracle maintains the same data controls at a user level, which means no individual sees data or AI recommendations that they’re not permissioned to see.

AI Agent Studio empowers enterprises to configure and build AI agents that extend their workforce and help achieve new levels of productivity. It allows you to harness the full potential of AI agents and transform the way work gets done in your organization.
AI Agent Studio is a design-time environment that provides a set of tools to create, customize, validate, and deploy GenAI features and AI agents to meet the specific needs of the organization. It is the same unified environment Oracle uses to internally build agents, made available now to customers and partners to customize and extend agents from Oracle-provided preconfigured templates or to create new agents and multi-agent workflows.

Like our AI capabilities, Oracle AI Agent Studio was built natively into Fusion Cloud Applications on our trusted, high performance Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which means it can easily and securely access Fusion knowledge stores, tools, and APIs and allows agents to be deployed directly into the flow of work. This approach means maximum flexibility and customization without sacrificing reliability or performance.
