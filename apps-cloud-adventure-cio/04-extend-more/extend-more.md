# Create AI Agents and Agent Teams for your enterprise


## Introduction

AI Agent Studio for Fusion Applications is a comprehensive platform for creating, extending, deploying and managing AI Agents and Agent Teams across the enterprise. Oracle AI Agent Studio delivers easy-to-use tools, including advanced testing, robust validation, and built-in security, that helps Oracle Fusion Applications customers and partners create and manage AI agents. Leveraging the same technology that Oracle uses to create AI agents, Oracle AI Agent Studio enables users to easily extend pre-packaged agents and/or create new agents and then deploy and manage them. 


### Objectives

In this activity, you will see your Oracle Cloud Adventure team use AI Agent Studio and build a new action agent. Following are the tasks you will see as part of this demonstration

   &emsp;  • Review Business Objects that allows the AI Agent Studio with easy access to application objects and data <br>
   &emsp;  • Create Deep Links for 1-click Access <br>
   &emsp;  • Create Tools <br>
   &emsp;  • Create a new Action Agent<br>

Estimated Time: 15 minutes


## AI Agent Studio Demo

## Summary

As you have seen, AI Agent Studio puts customers in the driver’s seat, helping empower you to design the future of AI in your organizations on top of a bedrock of trust and safety. AI Agent Studio includes a built-in testing environment, validation, and traceability tools to confirm accuracy. Oracle maintains the same data controls at a user level, which means no individual sees data or AI recommendations that they’re not permissioned to see.

AI Agent Studio empowers enterprises to configure and build AI agents that extend their workforce and help achieve new levels of productivity. It allows you to harness the full potential of AI agents and transform the way work gets done in your organization.
AI Agent Studio is a design-time environment that provides a set of tools to create, customize, validate, and deploy GenAI features and AI agents to meet the specific needs of the organization. It is the same unified environment Oracle uses to internally build agents, made available now to customers and partners to customize and extend agents from Oracle-provided preconfigured templates or to create new agents and multi-agent workflows.

Like our AI capabilities, Oracle AI Agent Studio was built natively into Fusion Cloud Applications on our trusted, high performance Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which means it can easily and securely access Fusion knowledge stores, tools, and APIs and allows agents to be deployed directly into the flow of work. This approach means maximum flexibility and customization without sacrificing reliability or performance.
